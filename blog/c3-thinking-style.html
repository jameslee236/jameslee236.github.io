<h1>Thinking Style - Concrete Random </h1>
<h2>08.12.15</h2>

<p>DBC has us working on and understanding the way in which we learn. Early on, we took a few quizzes for self-reflection and I found out I was a concrete-random learner. In laymen's terms, the way in which I learn is to focus on the "here and now" and to categorize these pieces of information into chunks. This allows me to have a randomness to my learning - starting in the middle of a list of instructions for example, and using my intuition to figure out how it starts and finishes. </p>

<p>One of the ways in which this is helpful is that I find myself always using a trial-error method. When I see the cause and effect of one change, I'm able to infer how it actually works better than if it's just simply explained to me. The drawback of this is that I can spend insane amounts of time tinkering with something and making very little progress just because I find it "interesting". This is where time-blocking becomes my friend. By setting aside a limited amount of time to tinker, I can move away from challenges that might take too long and absorb too much productivity. </p>

<p>Another way in which my concrete random learning style affects my learnings at DBC is that I find myself making simple errors. Missing a bracket there, missing a quotation mark in another place. This is because I work on multiple things at once instead of going through problems in a linear fashion. A couple ways I've been able to combat this is to get really good at analyzing the error messages and being diligent with debugging/running tests anytime I make a change. Secondly, pairing has been incredibly helpful for someone to spot-check my syntax. </p>

<p>As I become more aware of where I lack, I can choose to embrace the growth mindset and look for opportunities to grow. When I look at Anthony Gregorc's "Mind Styles", I find myself drawn to the sequential mode of thinking and learning as something that I can continue to develop in. This means embracing the orderly and methodical and following directions in a predictable manner. This can be done during each of the challenges and exercises we are given by reading the directions and instructions thoroughly before working on the solution. This can also be done by reading through the book and resources page by page, instead of skimming through various parts. This will help solidify my knowledge and supplement where I may lack understanding in certain subject matters. </p>
