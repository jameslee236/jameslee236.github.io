<p>
Before I begin DBC tomorrow for the onsite portion, I've been tasked with trying to understand what constitutes a "good" question. I realized that most software developers don't know everything (I know.. what a novel idea...) but that they've become really good at researching or asking the right people to help them solve their problems. So I looked through a couple resources to help me figure out the best structure for good questioning.
</p>
<p>
1. Summarize your question in your title
2. Explain the situation and help someone recreate your problem
3. Explain how you tried to solve your problem
4. Proofread, refactor your question
5. Follow-up and thank any helpers
</p>
<p>
1. Summarize your question in your title: <br>
The first one is to simply help with the fact that everyone is busy. And no one is obligated to help you. Every question answered is a genuine favor from someone and in order to catch their attention quickly, you need a good subject line. Like any great sales person would know, you need a great subject line to have someone open your email. But with developers, I think the style is a bit different. Straight forward, to-the-point, seems to be preferred. Almost like you're just asking one of your friends. The more specific questions seem to be better as well. Instead of "What is an array?", questions like "How do arrays work with hashes in Ruby?" are better.
</p>
<p>
2. Explain the situation and help someone recreate your problem: <br>
The second one is explaining clearly but without too many words what the situation is, how you got there, and what you're trying to solve for. This makes it easier for the person to understand how to recreate your situation and removes the need for assuming what you need. There's a saying in sales, "confused prospects don't buy" and it's the same for people looking to answer your question. Let's create the lowest barrier to entry so that more people can throw their input into the hat.
</p>

<p>
3. Explain how you tried to solve your problem: <br>
I think this one goes a long way. This isn't something I read but something I've noticed as a commonality amongst questions I answer. Whenever I see someone who has put in the effort, I feel more obligated to help if I see that they really are stuck! Maybe it's the cynical side of me but what if they're just being lazy? I wouldn't want to enable their laziness! But when I see that someone has taken the time to think it through and just need a fresh perspective or someone to supplement their understanding, I feel responsible in helping them.
</p>

<p>
4. Proofread, refactor your question: <br>
This one is a no-brainer. Again, remove all barriers to entry. And going back to #3, nobody wants to help someone who hasn't put in the necessary effort. 

</p>

<p>
5. Follow-up and thank any helpers: <br>
Again, this is a personal one I've learned in my short time working but it's a mindset thing. I never assume that I'm entitled to an answer. I think it takes some humility to ask and it someone takes a small risk when they answer you. What if they're wrong? They've done you a great favor in answering your question and if you want people to help you long-term, I think it's incredibly important to provide a kind gesture as a thank-you. Could be just a thank you or a written note. It could be a small gift-card to their favorite coffee place. Whatever, it is, as long as it's sincere, it goes a long way. Most people never do this and I think it'll help create a long-term environment where people are excited to assist you!
