  <h1>Week2 - HTML and CSS</h1>

      This week was a pretty intense week of basics and fundamentals. It was also a time for me to really start to get the feel for what coding is like. We started on HTML and CSS while learning about what makes websites work the way they do. The easiest way to think about the differences between HTML and CSS is to compare it to your body. HTML is like your bones, your skeleton. It provides the frame and structure for your website. CSS is like your skin and hair and all the other good stuff on the outside that makes you look as attractive as you do. It's all the styling and details that make websites look appealing.

      A couple things that stood out to me on a cultural level was the amount of repetitive adjusting and fidgeting that I needed to do to get the website looking the way that I wanted. It was simultaneously frustrating and satisfying. Frustrating in the sense that it would take 30 minutes to move something to the right one inch without breaking something else. Rewarding in the sense that it took 30 minutes and you finally figured it out. Trial and error are my friends at the moment.

      One of the concepts that actually stumped me was CSS positioning. CSS uses three different commands to place features or elements on the page. These three commands are padding, border, and margin. So what are the differences? I've attached an image that I found that helps visualize the differences. The only difference is where they add space to. Your paragraph, image or cool feature is considered the "content". If you want to add space immediately around it, you can use the padding feature. Adding a border around your content helps you have even more control and allows you to utilize the margin command. The margin command lets you place blank space outside of your border line. It's the blank space outside of the blank space if that makes any sense to you. 

      I'm really excited to utilize what I'm learning this week to create some really neat websites.
