  For the most part, a good portion of the week was dedicated to familiarizing ourselves with Git and Github. I've always heard about Github working in tech but never understood what it was. Git is essentially a version control software that allows you to manage and coordinate revisions to the code. As sales people, I'm sure you're familiar with email templates or marketing materials. It goes something like this: Email_template.doc, email_template1.doc, email_template2.doc, email_template2a.doc, etc. Git allows dev teams to manage all of this in a really systematic and orderly way. This is especially important in software development because you don't want to override or break one section of code while working on something else. It's important to have various versions so that if you DO break something, you can always go back to a stable version.

  So that's git. Github's a bit different; the easiest way I had it explained to me is that traditionally git was used locally, on your computer. Meaning just like an old flashdrive, whatever changes you made were restricted to your laptop. If you wanted to transfer the change to someone else on your team, you'd have to send them your flashdrive, or in other words, send your code or take your computer to them and be in the same physical location as them. Github did what Dropbox essentially did for documents. Like any cloud service, Github hosts all changes in it's remote servers and allow anyone to push changes and updates to the code while also allowing anyone with permissions to get the most stable and updated source code. Pretty cool right? Wish I had thought of a business like that. Can't actually believe people used to code without it.

  So that's been the first week. Really exciting stuff.I definitely feel like I'm learning a lot and really am enjoying how quickly things are moving. Hoping to keep learning at the pace that I am for the remaining weeks!
