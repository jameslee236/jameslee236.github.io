	Phase 0 at DevBootCamp has introduced us to the concept of pair programming. The idea is simple: working together helps alleviate frustration, reduce mistakes, and makes the overall coding experience more enjoyable. I've always been someone who's liked to work alone and so I was initially apprehensive about the idea of partnering with other people. What if they slow me down? What if I slow THEM down? But now that I've done about 10 pairing sessions, I can confidently say that they are miracle workers. It just works. When you have two people passionately looking for a solution and with enough interpersonal communication skills to relay what their thought process is, magic happens. 
</p>
<p>
	The biggest benefit of pair programming, at least in my mind, is having someone who can objectively look at your code and say, "I think we should do it a different way". As humans, we become so fixed on our way of thinking and the more time we invest into making that solution work, the more we get stuck. It's sunk cost (economic term) displayed perfectly. Even in my solo challenges, my solutions have come when I've taken a break and come back to my code, only to get a fresh perspective on the task at hand. This process is just expedited when you have someone working with you. 
</p> 
<p>
	Additionally, I've noticed that I tend to get my challenges done faster with partners who, although might not be the most technically savvy, are great communicators: great listeners, empathetic, and assertive. When they are both, it's extremely exciting and you feel like you can solve anything. 
</p>
<p>
	On the other side of pairing is the feedback portion. From my times in sales, I'd say that I've been proficient at giving feedback. I mean, that's how sales people get better right? They tell each other what to work on in uncomfortable situations. So I enjoy giving feedback and receiving feedback. The more honest, the more harsh, blunt, and direct the better on the receiving end. I've noticed that most feedback I've seen has lacked one component of the "kind, actionable, and specific" paradigm. I realize it might be in the milennial generation in which we currently live that shies away from telling people what to do but actionable feedback is just that. It's a nice way to tell someone what they need to do to become a better version of themselves. It's awesome and we as programmers and people in general, need to get better at it (myself included). 
</p>
<p>
	I really enjoy with feedback employs all three attributes - kind, actionable, and specific. For instance, I had a pairing session where I was utterly confused by the task at hand. I had also spent about 8 hours prior to the pairing session doing other assignments so my brain was fried. Needless to say, the pairing session was less than optimal and both of us left a bit frustrated. The feedback was probably nicer than it should have been but did mention that I looked "tired, jaded" and that I needed to be more assertive. That was amazing advice! I arguably took more from that pairing session than the ones where I breezed through and everything was peaches and cream.
</p>
<p>
	I'm looking forward to that pairing session in the future that stretches me to uncomfortable lengths. Maybe the person I'm partnered with is just rude, sloppy, and lacks empathy. Or maybe it's a deadline that causes us to stress and blow up towards one another. Regardless of the reason, I'm looking forward to the reconciliation afterwards and the hard feedback that'll follow in order to make me a better programmer/person/etc.
