As I get prepared to enter into the 'on-site' portion of DBC, I've been trying to prepare mentally and emotionally for not only the hours and the amount of instruction but also the people that I'll be working with. I'd even argue, having done sales, that people are more often the most frustrating part of a job. It's not often that the problem at hand frustrates you to the point of wanting to quit your job. No, it's often people and relational dynamics that make it difficult. So understanding this, I've been wanting to write a blog post about conflict in the hopes that I can refer back to it if needed.  
</p>
<p>
One of the conflicts I had was during my time at my previous sales job. I had just entered into a full-time closing role and I was eager and excited to prove that I could do it. So, when I landed my first deal that I felt was promising and substantial, I was excited. However, due to some sales territorial issues, I was forced to give up the opportunity that I had closed. In fact, the senior sales rep who it was supposed to be under, came to my desk, demanding that I give up the opportunity. I was FURIOUS. I recall told him that I was going to fight tooth and nail and make his life miserable for taking it. I know, very mature. I recall being frustrated, betrayed, and misunderstood as I sat there with my manager as he told me that I needed to give up the opportunity. I also felt scared. I had never done this before and this was my first exposure to the sales world. 
</p>
<p>
"Is it always going to be like this?", "Are people always going to take advantage of me?"

After I had some time to cool down, I was able to reflect on my emotional response. I had even shocked myself. Typically I was a cool team-player, someone that resisted the need to stir up drama. So why was I overreacting in such a way? I realized most of it was tied to my own feeling of inadequacy and this impulsive fear that I wouldn't be able to do this job. It was rooted in my own insecurity and although I still felt that I deserved the sales deal, I had still responded unfairly to the other sales rep. I walked over to his desk, apologized, and went over to my manager and apologized as well. I recall my manager telling me that I didn't have to apologize but it was for the sake of my conscience that I did so.  

</p>
<p>
A valuable lesson I learned through that experience was how to manage conflict in a professional, working environment. It's often unwise and unproductive to take matters into your own hands. If often will look poorly on you. So I learned how to level with my manager, to air my grievances objectively, and to let the process play out. Additionally, I learned a lot about myself and how to manage my own internal self-doubt. Interestingly enough, I ended up closing a $100k deal that quarter, resulting in obtaining 231% to sales quota. One loss or obstacle shouldn't derail your entire day, week, quarter, or career.
