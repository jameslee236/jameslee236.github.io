	I visted my friend Alby this summer in Seattle. Alby is a friendly and assertive Chinese-American who moved up for grad school to pursue his career ambitions as a psychologist serving minority populations. I had worked with Alby at a non-profit during my time in college. The work was mainly comprised of assisting schools strained with limited manpower and resources in districts like Oakland, Richmond, East San Jose, etc. I've seen and can attest that this man is incredibly aware of race and how it plays a factor in the overall social dynamics of our cities/state/nation. 
</p>
<p>
	So it was to my surprise that Alby, while looking at me directly in the eye, said "Seattle is the most racist city I've ever lived in". It wasn't Oakland where for the last 2-3 years, we've had consistent civil gatherings against racist police brutality. He made it very clear that in the hopes of being tolerant, that the people he encountered on a day-to-day basis, had become color-blind. "Oh, we don't believe in race"... "Oh, we don't see color" were things he mentioned he commonly heard amongst his peers at grad school. It was evident to him how being color blind excused privileged and entitlement as normal things that could be achieved by other minorities who were being pushed out by major gentrification.
</p>
<p>
	All of this came to mind as I researched Stereotype Threat and how our biases and stereotypes can negatively affect our peers in the classroom and in the workplace. As an Asian-American male, I've been on the positive and negative side of these perceptions. For instance, it's assumed by many people that I'm smart or a hardworker. This was evident in my previous work experiences. And like a self-fulfilling prophesy, I ended up being competent and a hard worker. But on the negative spectrum, it was assumed that I was passive or reluctant to speak up. What my manager might not have been able to see was that I was excellent at consensus building and getting people to work well together, of building harmony. I didn't have to be vocal about it because this was something I did on the ground level, in the day-to-day. This was because of my upbringing as an Asian-American. I've learned the high value of consensus and agreement as components of moving a family, a team, a group together in the same direction. By being boxed into a certain profile, I felt suffocated by the expectations that I felt I could not meet like other individuals could. 

</p>
<p>
	My ongoing process has been to not be afraid of speaking about race or diversity. This means that it invites difficult conversations because differences cause friction. But I want to embrace the friction and listen. Because on the other side of that difficult conversation is understanding and acceptance. As someone who is conflict-adverse, this is something I'm aware I have to be incredibly intentional about. Additionally, I think it makes an immediate contribution when you're aware that this dynamic exists. When we realize that race exists and that people come from all different backgrounds, it allows us to come with humility instead of judgment. It gives us an opportunity to ask one another about each others' perspective and to learn something new. Additionally, every person has a strength that they can contribute. If we can understand, then we can maximize those strengths and cover for one another's weaknesses instead of expose them.
