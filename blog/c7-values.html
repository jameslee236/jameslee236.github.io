      DBC has had us reflecting on our values this week. The one I wanted to hone in on is enthusiasm. I feel like sales people have something internally that helps them cope with ups and downs and I think most of it can be attributed to enthusiasm and optimism.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Enthusiasm has opened every door thus far for me. At some point in life, someone has to give you a chance; They have to take a risk on you. And people would rather take a risk on someone enthusiastic, eager, and optimistic if everything else is the same. Early on in my sales career, I sat in on an advanced sales training session and the speaker, who was a phenomenal sales person, said the best advice he ever got was from someone who told him, "it's hard to say no to a smiling idiot." 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last piece of advice I gave was to an old friend who came back to Berkeley after going back to grad school. We had both experienced a really traumatic experience in college and although many of those involved had moved on, she did not because she had been away. With all the emotions and conflict she was feeling, she asked me on how I had coped and moved on. I spoke a lot into having hope, faith, and a strong sense of identity in order to make the right decision. It's removing the fantasy of a perfect ending but still remaining optimistic, that even through trials, that something meaningful and significant will come of it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my experience working in sales and going door-to-door, I found that positive affirmations are essential to maintaining my level of confidence. In fact, after doing it for so long, I feel like it's become a habit; second-nature to my day-to-day. I believe this will help me overcome some of the adverse moments at DBC. Positive affirmations need to be believable and have to be spoken verbally, outloud in order to be effective, even if it means looking stupid. Something about hearing it over and over again allows you to refrain from the dark thoughts going through your head. It's powerful. It works. And I wish more people did it in their day-to-day.
