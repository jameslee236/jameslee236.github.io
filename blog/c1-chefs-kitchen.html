    <p>
      It's so good to be reminded of why I'm here. I'm not only here to be a consumer but a producer. To create meaningful things and not just software or products but people. I love the approach, the mindset, and the passion of DBC to do this effectively. It's so refreshing to see a program that looks to develop the whole person and to push them to do more than they thought they ever could. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've created 4 principles for myself to keep my mindset in the right place, especially as things get stressful.
      1. Stay late - Nothing can substitute time and effort.
      2. Breathe - stay patient, listen before you speak.
      3. Trust the process  - You havenâ€™t arrived.
      4. Make a difference - Leave the program better than you found it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm hoping not only to learn a ton about programming but also about myself and about people. I'm looking forward to making some great friends and to make a difference in peoples' lives.
