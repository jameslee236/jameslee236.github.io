	This week, I was exposed to inheritance, scope, and other multi-layered lines of code. I mostly interacted and used classes to do this. Upon reading Practical Object Oriented Ruby, I became interested in the design of clean and reusable code. So, one of the concepts that I researched were Modules.
</p>
<p>
	Modules, in simplest terms, provide methods that can be used across multiple classes. They function as libraries that have constants, methods, and classes that can be used multiple times in other classes. This means your code isn't as DRY (don't repeat yourself) and can help you avoid any potential conflicts.Modules also can be mixed into our classes. This is called mixins. Mixed-in modules behave like superclasses and can provide additional functionality to classes.
</p>
<p>
	Another example for when Modules can be helpful are for namespaces, as applications and programs get larger, Modules define a namespace that is excluded from all the other rules and can therefore play nicely with other methods, constants, and classes. If you have multiple things named the exact same name, Modules can help you avoid those bugs.

</p>
<p>
	In comparison, it's easy to look at a class as a mini-module. Modules are composed of methods, constants, and classes. Classes include methods, constants, but variables instead of classes. Classes also have inheritance in which it can take on attributes while modules have no inheritance. In both instances, it becomes very clear that modules are one level above classes if you're looking at it from a top-down hierarchy. The usage of both depend on what you're looking to accomplish. Classes are main used to create objects while modules are a way to mix-in different methods, constants, and classes into various places within your code.
