<h1>Burn Rates and the Tech World's Hubris</h1>
<h2>08.23.15</h2>

<p1>
	Silicon Valley and the tech industry has always attracted the dreamers. Men and women equipped with words that entice and invoke a vision in others are often lauded as saviors and world-changers. It's also a modern-day outlet for entrepreneurs, who in former centuries, would have been empire builders and saavy generals. It's just now, you can build a business without the risk of a rebellion or a malcontent in one of your colonies coming to cut your head of.
</p1>

	The media certainly doesn't help to keep the hype under control. On the contrary, the media feeds it. They want rocketships - companies that blow up. But this attracts attention-craving, egotistical entrepreneurs who, with only a good idea, but with poor character and ability to execute, can have moments in the limelight, but often blow up as fast as they started.
</p2> 
<p3>
	One of the biggest problems of the tech world is the hubris, the greed, and the lack of transparency that comes with it all. Oversold and under-delivered, often times, it becomes hard to distinguish fact from fiction. For every company that succeeds and successfully exits, whether through IPO or acquisition, dozens more fail.Clinkle, Better Place, and Fab come to mind as well-documented failures recently. Wasted venture capital ranges from $50 million to over $500 million within these 3 examples alone. Although the product and the vision are often different, those that fail usually have the same story. 
</p3>

	Here's the story in 10 steps:
		1. A Steve Job-esque founder with a great idea captivates VCs and employees alike.
		2. A big round of funding is raised and strategic hires are made. Media hype ensues.
		3a. No viable product is available, no market fit, no long-term strategy towards profitability.
		4. Continue to hire positions that are not needed. Hire friends and family but never someone with the right experience.
		5. Excessively spend money on lavish set-ups, offices, and other amenities but never the product.
		6. There's now a minimally viable product but no market fit.
		7. Employees start wondering what's going on. The co-founder bullshits his/her way into keeping everyone around longer. Everything looks good and the future is bright.
		8. Key employees in the C-Level start to leave. 
		9. Employees stop trusting the founder and rumors start about the diminishing runway the company has.
		10. Everyone realizes it's a phony company. Millions of VC funding and dozens of people's lives are devastated. 
</p4>

	There aren't very many solutions that I can offer having never run a start-up. Additionally, many of these are structural and institutionalized within the systems of the tech world. However, I've established a mindset as I look for potential employers.Ask hard questions during the latter half of the interview. If they're transparent then, they'll be transparent later. 
		1. Is there a business model? What's the product market fit? What's the plan for profitability? What's the competition like?
		2. Does the founder have great credentials? PHD or Masters degree from a top university? Have they successfully started a company before? I might miss out on the next Mark Zuckerberg but I think I'll hit more than I miss.
		3. Would the founders be good parents? Could you trust them? Are they reliable? Do they make sacrifices for the company? Or is it all about their ego and success?
		4. Do they care about the customer? Are they devoting resources to product and engineering to please customers, reduce churn, and build a long-term business? Or is it only sales/marketing with very little product?

	My belief is that you learn just as much from these failures as you do successes. And often times, the story of the successes are often undocumented or maybe under-documented by the media. Success often looks boring: hiring the person with the right skillset instead of the bloated resume, deciding to tell your company the truth when it's difficult to do so, and on and on. Ben Horowitz, the famous venture capitalist, wrote a book called, "The Hard Thing About Hard Things", highlighting the seemingly miniscule decisions made in pressure-packed moments that often define a companies trajectory. These require immense character, boldness, and resolve and therefore should be documented. But they're often not spoken about and this leaves room for failure stories. After all, everyone likes a crash and burn story.
