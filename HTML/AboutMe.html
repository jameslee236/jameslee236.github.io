  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Thanks for visiting my site! My verbose short story is this: I'm from Torrance, CA, raised by two immigrant parents who worked stupidly hard. With their support I made it to UC Berkeley where I studied political economics. Once I got to call, I did a crazy internship where I spent my summers selling books door to door to pay for school. That got me interested in sales, and upon graduating was the easiest way for me to find work. I found a killer job at AdRoll, one of the tech industry's darlings when I joined. While doing my job, I found a passion for leveraging technology to make people's jobs easier. Selling into the B2B industry, I was exposed to so many companies doing meaningful things. That made me look introspectively at my life. I was doing well in sales but didn't find meaning in it. I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to learn and grow instead of doing my routine every day and getting paid. That's why I decided to make the leap into software development. And so far, it's been a great decision. 

      In my spare time, I watch sports (Go Eagles, Golden Bears, and Dodgers!), e-sports (video games!), hike, and take short road-trips. A lover of routine, I'm a hardcore oatmeal, sandwich, and asian food lover. I'm insanely picky about my food. And I can only fall asleep if I listen to someone lecturing (a habit from my last year at CAL).
